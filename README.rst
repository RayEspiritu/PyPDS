An easy way to get started using PyPDS is to clone its GitHub repository. The repository includes a directory containing some example PDS files to work with.

The following will place a directory called PyPDS in your working directory.

	git clone git://github.com/RyanBalfanz/PyPDS.git
	
For instant gratification, change to the PyPDS/src directory and fire up a Python interpreter.

	cd PyPDS/src
	python
	
From there you should be able to start playing with PyPDS and the included test files.
	
Or, if you'd like to install PyPDS system wide, first grab a copy of the code as above. Then install with distutils.
