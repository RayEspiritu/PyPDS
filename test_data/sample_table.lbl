    For purposes of sorting alphabetically, the ASCII collating sequence      
    was used.  Space characters (example:  The NORC) and punctuation          
    (example:  A'Hearn) were regarded as significant during the sort          
    procedure.  Case was not regarded as significant.                         
                                                                              
    For purposes of sorting by designation, chronological order was           
    used; that is, 1929 RO precedes 1929 RB1.  Palomar-Leiden and Trojan      
    survey designations are grouped separately.  Old style designations       
    (pre-1925) are not included in the list.                                  
                                                                              
    Due to the limitations of the ASCII character set, diacritical marks      
    are lost in this machine-readable form.
